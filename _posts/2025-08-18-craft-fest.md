Craft Fest is an event that primarily highlights creators working in traditional crafts and handmade goods — a refreshing change from the usual ACG-focused conventions I’m used to. As someone who mainly creates illustration-based merchandise rooted in anime, games, and fandom, this wasn’t my typical scene… but I decided to give it a shot anyway, encouraged by a few friends who were also attending.

I applied together with my talented friend Ponponponka, and we booked two tables side by side. Out of pure kindness (and knowing I have way too many things to display), my boothmate generously allowed me to take up the majority of the shared space for my merch. I’m super grateful for that — it really helped me showcase a wider variety of my work and made the setup feel a lot more “me.”

Going into the event, I wasn’t entirely sure what to expect. The audience at Craft Fest is quite different — many attendees are there for handmade crafts, artisanal goods, and slow-made pieces — not necessarily the usual prints, charms, or fan-inspired items. That said, I saw it as a good opportunity to try something new, reach a different crowd, and simply enjoy the event with friends.

To my surprise, I ended up seeing so many familiar faces throughout the day! Maybe it was because the event was free entry and held at Suntec, which made it convenient — but it felt like everyone decided to drop by. I really enjoyed catching up, chatting, and reconnecting with fellow artists, supporters, and friends I hadn’t seen in a while. That social aspect made the whole experience feel incredibly warm and fulfilling, even beyond just selling merch.

While it wasn't the best event in terms of sales (as expected, given the different demographic), it was a really wholesome and low-pressure experience. The atmosphere was cozy, the fellow vendors were incredibly creative and kind, and the visitors were respectful and genuinely curious. I also appreciated the chance to slow down, observe how different creators presented their work, and even reflect on how I could incorporate more handmade or traditional elements into my own creations in the future.

Overall, I wouldn’t say Craft Fest is the best fit for my usual product line — but I’m really glad I went. It was a valuable learning experience, a great chance to connect with the community, and a refreshing change of pace from my usual con routine.
