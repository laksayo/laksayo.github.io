Apple-y Ever After is an unofficial Caleb Cupsleeve Fancafe held on 7-8 June at 5themoments Jalan Besar branch. We began working and planning for the cafe since January this year, when we were drinking at the bar under the first anniversary billboard. What started as a casual remark and idea became our passion project for the next 6 months.

We spent Friday evening setting up the cafe, decorating the venue according to the theme of the event. Learning from our previous cafe, we planned ahead and came up with counter measures to various scenarios that could happen. Responsibility and roles were distributed clearly and briefed clearly. I was mainly on cosplayer duty for both days of the event, and I had a timetable planned out clearly. The detailed schedule let me know when I was supposed to be at my VIP tables and when I had free time. The schedule was relaxing enough that we had time to take breathers and film content for social media.

I was really happy to have many supportive friends who came to visit. They brought snacks and drinks for me and I spent a lot of my time sneakily chomping during the VIP sessions they booked with me. The staff members complained that I was eating in so many behind the scenes footage... 

For this cafe, the cosplayers have each prepared a mysterious unique interaction for our VIPs. I was Farspace Colonel Caleb on day 1, and I prepared a baton to recreate the interrogation scene. For the second day, I wore his Spring and Flowers outfit. I made the flower featured in his 5* card and gave one to every VIP table I had. I was happy to hear that my VIPs enjoyed the unique interactions I prepared. During our down time, I also experienced the interactions prepared by the other cosplayers.

I was really proud and happy with how the event turned out. The team was such a joy to work with. Everyone was so diligent and kind. A lot of effort was put into organising the event and it really shows. I enjoyed spending time with all my friends and VIPs. I will always look back fondly on this event, through the numerous footage and memories sent to me by friends. I will look forward to future events by spacefarer sanctuary as well.
