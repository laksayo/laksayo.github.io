# Hello!

**I’m Laksayo — a digital artist based in Singapore! Welcome to my portfolio and blog!**

I create both original and fandom-inspired merchandise, blending my personal style with the stories and characters I love. My work is all about sharing joy, creativity, and connection — whether it’s through a favorite fandom or something entirely from my imagination.

I started tabling at conventions in 2014 with a group of friends, and that experience sparked a journey I’m endlessly grateful for. Thanks to the incredible support from fans and fellow artists, I’ve been able to turn this passion into a full-time pursuit.

I’m always excited to meet new people, share my art, and make lasting connections along the way. Let’s keep creating and celebrating the things we love, together!


## Thank you so much for supporting my small business — it truly means the world to me! :>

At the moment, I am no longer selling items internationally or online. I will still be selling at conventions and you can check [Conventions page]({{ "/conventions/" | relative_url }}) to see where and when my booth will pop up next!
