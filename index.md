# Welcome to My Portfolio and Blog!

<div class="intro">
 <p>Hi, I’m Laksayo — a digital artist based in Singapore!

I create both original and fandom-inspired merchandise, blending my personal style with the stories and characters I love. My work is all about sharing joy, creativity, and connection — whether it’s through a favorite fandom or something entirely from my imagination.
I started tabling at conventions in 2014 with a group of friends, and that experience sparked a journey I’m endlessly grateful for. Thanks to the incredible support from fans and fellow artists, I’ve been able to turn this passion into a full-time pursuit.
I’m always excited to meet new people, share my art, and make lasting connections along the way. Let’s keep creating and celebrating the things we love, together!</p>
